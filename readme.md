# Snake Clone for Switch

This is my first Switch C++ application, it was supposed to be a test I had in class, and I thought about porting it over to the Switch.
It is made using the `SDL2 SDL2_ttf SDL2_image SDL2_mixer` libraries.

## How to compile
To compile that, you need to have the devkitPRO toolchain installed. Once that's done, clone the project and then type in this command

```bash
make
```
Once that's done, you'll have an NRO file that's ready to use on your Switch.

## How do I play the game

Well it's Snake, it's quite straightforward
* Use the directional pad to control your snake
* Press + to pause the game
* Press - to restart the game
